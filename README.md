# Issues
Nothing to see here but issues ;)
Make an issue once you find bugs!

# How can I report bugs to you?
Run the commands below via the terminal app (after the crash or bugs happend)
"/usr/libexec/droid-hybris/system/bin/logcat"
"devel-su journalctl"
"devel-su dmesg"
Then pastebin the output of those commands for me
( use paste.ubuntu.com etc ... )
That's all :)
